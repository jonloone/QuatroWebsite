## Challenge

A Fortune 500 oil and gas operator faced a critical challenge: their operational data was fragmented across 40+ regional historian databases spanning upstream, midstream, and downstream operations. Each region had deployed different SCADA and historian systems over decades, creating data silos that made cross-system analysis nearly impossible.

Engineering teams spent hours aggregating data from multiple sources just to answer basic operational questions. Predictive analytics initiatives were stalled because the data they needed was locked in proprietary formats across incompatible systems.

## Solution

Quatro Connect was deployed as a unified data layer, connecting to every existing historian and SCADA system without requiring replacement. The platform's 8,000+ connectors normalized data from legacy OSIsoft PI instances, Aveva historians, and dozens of vendor-specific systems into a consistent, queryable format.

Edge deployments at remote facilities ensured continuous data collection even with intermittent connectivity, while the cloud-based analytics layer provided enterprise-wide visibility for the first time.

## Results

Within six months of deployment:

- **200,000+ data points** unified in a single platform
- **60% reduction** in integration maintenance costs
- **Real-time visibility** across all operations for the first time
- **Foundation established** for predictive analytics initiatives previously deemed impossible

The operations team can now query years of operational history across all regions in seconds, enabling rapid root cause analysis and trend identification that was previously impractical.
