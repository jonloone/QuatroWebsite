## Challenge

A national infrastructure provider operating thousands of distributed sites across the country struggled with network visibility. Their NOC relied on multiple monitoring tools that didn't communicate, leading to delayed detection, inefficient dispatch, and extended outages.

Field technicians were often dispatched without complete information about site conditions, leading to wasted trips and prolonged resolution times. The reactive approach to maintenance meant equipment failures caused unexpected outages that impacted SLAs.

## Solution

Quatro Command unified all monitoring data into a single NOC platform, providing real-time visibility across every site and system. AI-powered analytics correlate events across sources and surface probable root causes, reducing the noise that previously overwhelmed operators.

Smart dispatch capabilities ensure field technicians receive complete site information, history, and troubleshooting guidance before arriving. Predictive maintenance models identify equipment at risk of failure, enabling proactive replacement.

## Results

After full deployment:

- **99.97% network uptime** achieved and sustained
- **40% reduction** in truck rolls through smarter dispatch and remote resolution
- **Minutes** for mean time to detect, down from hours
- **Predictive maintenance** prevents failures before they impact service

The NOC team now operates proactively instead of reactively, with AI handling event correlation and prioritization so operators can focus on complex issues.
