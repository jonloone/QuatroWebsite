## Challenge

A global manufacturing leader operated production lines where unplanned downtime cost $50,000+ per hour in lost production, expedited repairs, and missed customer commitments. Their maintenance approach was calendar-based, leading to both over-maintenance of healthy equipment and unexpected failures of aging assets.

Tribal knowledge about equipment behavior lived in the heads of experienced operators, but this expertise couldn't scale across facilities or survive retirements.

## Solution

Quatro Connect unified data from PLCs, sensors, and existing historians across all production lines. Quatro Operate's machine learning models were trained on historical equipment data to recognize patterns that precede failures — subtle changes in vibration, temperature, and performance that human operators couldn't detect consistently.

The system captures and codifies operational expertise into playbooks and automated responses, ensuring knowledge persists beyond individual operators.

## Results

In the first year of operation:

- **$2M+ saved** from prevented failures and optimized maintenance
- **30% reduction** in unplanned downtime
- **3 weeks advance warning** on a critical bearing failure that would have shut down the main production line
- **Knowledge capture** ensures expertise scales across all facilities

Maintenance has shifted from reactive to predictive, with AI surfacing equipment that needs attention before operators would notice any degradation.
