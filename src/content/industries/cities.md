challenges:
  - title: "Departmental Data Silos"
    description: "Traffic, public safety, utilities, and environmental monitoring operate as independent fiefdoms with separate technology stacks. No system sees the full picture."
  - title: "Vendor Lock-In Across Systems"
    description: "A mid-size city operates 15-30 separate platforms from different vendors with proprietary data formats. Integration projects are expensive and politically contentious."
  - title: "Reactive Operations"
    description: "Infrastructure failures and incidents are discovered after they occur. The sensor data to predict and prevent them is trapped in disconnected systems with no analytics layer."
  - title: "Multi-Agency Coordination Gaps"
    description: "A water main break affects traffic, public safety, fleet dispatch, and environmental monitoring simultaneously — but no system coordinates the cross-agency response."
capabilities:
  - name: "Unified City Operations Center"
    description: "Single common operating picture across all city departments. Replace 5-10 separate consoles with role-based workspaces for every agency."
  - name: "AI Urban Surveillance"
    description: "Real-time behavioral analytics across city-wide camera networks. Multi-sensor fusion with gunshot detection, license plate recognition, and access control."
  - name: "Cross-Agency Emergency Response"
    description: "Automated coordination workflows span department boundaries. Multi-domain incidents trigger coordinated responses across police, fire, EMS, and public works."
  - name: "Smart Infrastructure Monitoring"
    description: "Continuous condition monitoring for streetlights, traffic signals, water systems, and distributed infrastructure with predictive maintenance."
  - name: "Municipal Fleet Optimization"
    description: "AI-powered route optimization for waste collection, public works, and transit. Fill-level sensors enable demand-driven collection scheduling."
  - name: "Environmental Intelligence"
    description: "Air quality, weather, and energy data correlated with operational systems. Pollutant concentrations trigger traffic rerouting and public notifications."
platformMapping:
  connect: "8,000+ connectors for traffic controllers (NTCIP), cameras (ONVIF), building systems (BACnet, KNX), transit (GTFS, SIRI), and environmental sensors. Edge processing at intersections and vehicles."
  operate: "AI video analytics with behavioral analysis and crowd dynamics. Traffic pattern prediction, predictive maintenance for infrastructure, and environmental correlation. 80% fewer false alarms."
  command: "Unified city operations center with cross-agency coordination. Emergency response playbooks orchestrate multi-department response. Fleet dispatch for public works and waste collection."
