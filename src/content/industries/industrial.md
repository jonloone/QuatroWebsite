challenges:
  - title: "Data Fragmentation"
    description: "The average industrial enterprise runs 897 applications of which only 29% are integrated. Historians, MES, ERP, and CMMS each hold a slice of the operational picture."
  - title: "Unplanned Downtime"
    description: "Equipment failures cost a median of $125,000 per hour. Most organizations still rely on reactive or calendar-based maintenance that discovers problems after they manifest."
  - title: "Tag-Based Licensing Penalties"
    description: "Legacy historians charge per data point, creating financial disincentives for comprehensive data collection and limiting the breadth of AI analytics."
  - title: "Workforce Knowledge Erosion"
    description: "Retiring operators take decades of process intuition with them. 36% annual turnover in warehousing means institutional knowledge is perpetually at risk."
capabilities:
  - name: "Predictive Maintenance"
    description: "AI models forecast equipment failures 2-4 weeks in advance. Multi-sensor correlation catches compound failure modes that single-variable monitoring misses."
  - name: "OEE Optimization"
    description: "Real-time availability, performance, and quality metrics correlated with root-cause analytics that identify specific drivers of OEE loss."
  - name: "Cross-Domain Correlation"
    description: "Analyze relationships between maintenance data, process parameters, quality results, energy consumption, and logistics flows simultaneously."
  - name: "Digital Twin"
    description: "Real-time digital representations enable simulation and what-if analysis. Reduce trial batches by 40% through virtual process optimization."
  - name: "Legacy Coexistence"
    description: "Layer alongside existing OSIsoft PI, AspenTech, or Honeywell historians without migration. No tag-based licensing at any scale."
  - name: "Multi-Plant Coordination"
    description: "Enterprise-wide visibility and coordinated response across multiple facilities. Standardize best practices and benchmark performance."
platformMapping:
  connect: "8,000+ connectors for OPC-UA, Modbus, MQTT, BACnet, and enterprise systems. No tag-based licensing. Edge processing maintains local intelligence during connectivity loss."
  operate: "AI analytics for predictive maintenance, OEE tracking, and anomaly detection. Digital twin enables simulation and scenario planning. 80% fewer false alarms than threshold-based systems."
  command: "Multi-plant coordination and automated incident response. Resource dispatch based on real-time demand, location, and skill requirements."
