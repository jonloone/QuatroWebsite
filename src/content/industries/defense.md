challenges:
  - title: "Siloed Physical and Cyber Security"
    description: "Physical security and cyber security operate in separate command structures with separate tools. Convergent attacks spanning both domains go undetected."
  - title: "Classification Boundaries"
    description: "Defense environments operate across multiple classification levels with distinct network architectures. Solutions must function in fully air-gapped configurations."
  - title: "Legacy Integration Burden"
    description: "Installations typically operate 15-30+ disparate systems accumulated over decades. Integration projects consume 40-60% of defense IT project budgets."
  - title: "Distributed Operations"
    description: "Forward-deployed locations and distributed installations require autonomous operation with intermittent connectivity and no cloud dependency."
capabilities:
  - name: "Perimeter Protection"
    description: "AI video analytics with multi-sensor fusion (camera, radar, lidar, fiber-optic) delivers sub-30-second detection-to-response with 80% fewer false alarms."
  - name: "Federated Command"
    description: "Single command interface spanning 12+ installations and FOBs. Maintains local autonomy while enabling centralized oversight without network consolidation."
  - name: "Air-Gapped Operations"
    description: "Full analytical capability at the tactical edge without cloud connectivity. Purpose-built for classified operations on isolated networks at IL4/IL5/IL6."
  - name: "Automated Force Protection"
    description: "Pre-defined response playbooks triggered automatically by detected events — escalating alerts, notifying responders, and activating countermeasures."
  - name: "Logistics Intelligence"
    description: "Convoy planning reduced from hours to minutes. AI-assisted route optimization integrates real-time threat, weather, and vehicle readiness data."
  - name: "Compliance Audit Trails"
    description: "Every detection, alert, decision, and action logged with timestamp and chain-of-command context. Satisfies defense oversight and legal requirements."
platformMapping:
  connect: "Multi-sensor ingestion for cameras, radar, lidar, fiber-optic, seismic, and RF sensors. STANAG support for NATO interoperability. Edge processing for air-gapped environments."
  operate: "AI video analytics with real-time object detection, classification, and tracking. Multi-sensor fusion reduces false alarms by 80%. Anomaly detection across all monitored domains."
  command: "Federated command across 12+ FOBs. Automated force protection playbooks. Role-based workspaces for commander, watch officer, analyst, and responder roles."
