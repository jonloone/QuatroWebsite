challenges:
  - title: "Multi-Vendor Fragmentation"
    description: "Telecom operators run 5-15 distinct NMS tools from different vendors. Each generates alerts in proprietary formats, making cross-domain root cause analysis manual and slow."
  - title: "Alert Fatigue"
    description: "NOCs are overwhelmed by alerts — the majority false positives or symptomatic noise. Operators waste time triaging events that don't require action while genuine incidents get buried."
  - title: "Skilled Labor Shortage"
    description: "Infrastructure operations depend on experienced engineers who understand complex systems. New hires face 12-18 month ramp-up periods as experts retire."
  - title: "Reactive Maintenance"
    description: "Fleet and facility maintenance remains calendar-based or break-fix. Predictive data exists but sits in disconnected systems with no analytics layer."
