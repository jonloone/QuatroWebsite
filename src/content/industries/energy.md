challenges:
  - title: "Legacy SCADA Limitations"
    description: "Control systems installed 15-25 years ago rely on serial protocols and proprietary data formats. They cannot scale for DER integration, advanced analytics, or modern cybersecurity."
  - title: "Vendor-Siloed Operations"
    description: "Each equipment vendor provides its own management platform. Operators toggle between 5-7 separate tools to diagnose a single issue across generation, transmission, and distribution."
  - title: "DER Integration Complexity"
    description: "Every new solar array, battery, and EV charger adds endpoints with different protocols. Legacy SCADA has no native capability to handle DER telemetry."
  - title: "Physical-OT Convergence Gap"
    description: "Security and operational monitoring operate as separate programs with separate tools. Compound threats spanning physical and cyber domains go unrecognized."
capabilities:
  - name: "SCADA Overlay Modernization"
    description: "Mirror data from existing ABB, Siemens, GE, and Schneider SCADA in real time. Add modern analytics without touching safety-critical control paths."
  - name: "Pipeline Integrity & Security"
    description: "Multi-method leak detection with AI cross-correlation. Fuse RTTM, acoustic, and satellite monitoring for 75% fewer false alarms and 0.5% flow sensitivity."
  - name: "DER Integration"
    description: "Native connectivity for SunSpec, OCPP, and IEEE 2030.5. Onboard solar, wind, battery storage, and EV charging into your grid operational view."
  - name: "Grid Storm Response"
    description: "Automated playbooks pre-position crews, activate mutual aid, and prioritize restoration by customer impact and critical facility status."
  - name: "Cross-Domain Correlation"
    description: "Correlate operational events with security events, weather data, and external intelligence. Surface compound threats that siloed tools miss."
  - name: "Compliance Automation"
    description: "Continuous NERC CIP, PHMSA, and EPA audit trails. Replace 40+ hours/month of manual documentation with real-time compliance reporting."
platformMapping:
  connect: "Native connectivity for DNP3, IEC 61850, OPC-UA, and MQTT. Mirrors data from legacy SCADA and historians without tag-based licensing. 8,000+ connectors for any energy asset."
  operate: "AI analytics for predictive maintenance, multi-method leak detection, and grid anomaly detection. Digital twin enables contingency analysis and DER hosting capacity studies."
  command: "Automated storm playbooks coordinate 200+ substations. Intelligent dispatch assigns certified crews. NERC CIP and PHMSA audit trails generated automatically."
