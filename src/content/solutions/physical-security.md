challenges:
  - title: "Siloed Security Systems"
    description: "Video, access control, and intrusion detection operate as disconnected islands. Operators manually correlate across 4-6 separate consoles during incidents."
  - title: "False Alarm Overload"
    description: "Motion-based detection generates overwhelming false positives. After 20 minutes of continuous monitoring, operator detection rates drop below 50%."
  - title: "Reactive-Only Posture"
    description: "Video is recorded but rarely reviewed proactively. Cameras function as forensic tools rather than real-time threat detection systems."
  - title: "No Operational Context"
    description: "Security events happen in isolation from facility operations. A door-forced-open alarm is treated the same whether during maintenance or at 2 AM."

platformMapping:
  connect: "Camera-agnostic integration with 99% of IP cameras via ONVIF. Multi-sensor ingestion spans radar, lidar, thermal, fiber-optic, and access control systems."
  operate: "AI video analytics perform real-time behavioral analysis. Multi-sensor fusion requires verification before alerting — dramatically reducing false positives."
  command: "Automated playbooks coordinate multi-step responses in seconds. Intelligent dispatch assigns the nearest qualified responder with GPS-based routing."
