challenges:
  - title: "Fragmented Detection Domains"
    description: "Leak detection, physical security, and SCADA operate independently with no cross-correlation. Critical response time is lost toggling between systems."
  - title: "False Positive Overload"
    description: "Single-method detection generates 50-80% false alarm rates. Alarm fatigue increases the risk that genuine events are dismissed."
  - title: "Remote Terrain Blind Spots"
    description: "Pipeline corridors cross deserts, mountains, and tundra where continuous physical monitoring is impractical and patrol cycles leave gaps."
  - title: "Disconnected Response Workflows"
    description: "Detection triggers phone calls and ad-hoc coordination. No unified playbook ties detection to response to resolution."
