challenges:
  - title: "Vendor-Siloed Visibility"
    description: "Each equipment vendor provides its own NMS with proprietary data formats. NOC operators context-switch across 5-10 tools to diagnose a single issue."
  - title: "Alarm Fatigue"
    description: "Multi-vendor networks generate massive alarm volumes where 80%+ are non-actionable noise. Genuine faults get buried while operators chase symptoms."
  - title: "Manual Provisioning Bottlenecks"
    description: "Service activation across multi-vendor networks relies on manual CLI configuration with handoffs that introduce errors and extend delivery timelines."
  - title: "Reactive Fault Management"
    description: "Without predictive analytics and cross-domain correlation, fault management remains reactive. The same manual steps repeat for every incident."
