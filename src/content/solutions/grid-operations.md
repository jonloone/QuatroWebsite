challenges:
  - title: "Legacy SCADA Limitations"
    description: "Control systems from the 1990s and 2000s cannot scale for DER integration, advanced analytics, or modern cybersecurity. Full replacement takes 3-5 years."
  - title: "DER Integration Complexity"
    description: "Every new solar array, battery, and EV charger adds endpoints with different protocols. Legacy SCADA has no native DER capability."
  - title: "Fragmented Grid Visibility"
    description: "Generation, transmission, distribution, and DER live in separate systems. Operators lack a unified view from generator to meter."
  - title: "Manual Storm Coordination"
    description: "Severe weather triggers phone calls, radio, and spreadsheets. No automated playbooks pre-position resources based on weather forecasts."

  - name: "Distribution Management"
    description: "End-to-end monitoring with automated fault isolation, load balancing, and outage management across the distribution network."
  - name: "DER Integration"
    description: "Seamless onboarding of solar, wind, battery storage, and EV charging — normalized into your grid operational view."
  - name: "SCADA Modernization"
    description: "Overlay existing SCADA with modern analytics without touching the safety-critical control path. Migrate at your own pace."

platformMapping:
  connect: "Native connectivity for DNP3, IEC 61850, and OPC-UA. Mirrors data from legacy SCADA in real time while adding DER connectivity through SunSpec, OCPP, and IEEE 2030.5."
  operate: "AI analytics for predictive maintenance, grid anomaly detection, and DER performance optimization. Digital twin enables contingency analysis and storm modeling."
  command: "Automated storm playbooks coordinate 200+ substations. Intelligent dispatch assigns certified crews with switching authority. NERC CIP audit trails generated automatically."
