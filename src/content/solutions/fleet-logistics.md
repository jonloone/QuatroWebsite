challenges:
  - title: "Fragmented Visibility"
    description: "Vehicle location, cargo conditions, maintenance records, and driver compliance live in 3-5 separate systems that dispatchers toggle between."
  - title: "Static Route Planning"
    description: "Routes are planned once and cannot adapt to real-time conditions. Traffic, weather, and shifting priorities require manual intervention."
  - title: "Cargo Blind Spots"
    description: "High-value and temperature-sensitive shipments transit without continuous monitoring. Excursions are discovered at delivery, not in transit."
  - title: "Reactive Maintenance"
    description: "Without predictive analytics, fleet maintenance is either calendar-based (wasteful) or failure-based (costly roadside breakdowns)."
capabilities:
  - name: "Real-Time Vehicle Tracking"
    description: "GPS and telemetry for every vehicle on a unified operational map with sub-second position updates and status overlays."
  - name: "AI Route Optimization"
    description: "Dynamic routing that factors in traffic, weather, vehicle capacity, and delivery windows — with in-flight re-routing when conditions change."
  - name: "Cargo Monitoring"
    description: "Continuous temperature, humidity, and shock monitoring with automated alerts and compliance-ready chain-of-custody documentation."
  - name: "Driver Safety & Compliance"
    description: "Behavior scoring, fatigue detection, and hours-of-service tracking with automated coaching and regulatory compliance."
  - name: "Predictive Maintenance"
    description: "AI models correlate diagnostics, usage patterns, and environmental conditions to forecast failures 1-3 weeks in advance."
  - name: "Centralized Dispatch"
    description: "Unified dispatch console for managing fleet, crews, and deliveries with intelligent assignment and real-time tracking."
platformMapping:
  connect: "Ingests data from any GPS, telematics device, or IoT sensor. Normalizes data from mixed hardware fleets without requiring vendor standardization."
  operate: "AI analytics for route optimization, predictive maintenance, and driver safety. Digital twin enables fleet sizing and depot placement modeling."
  command: "Centralized dispatch with automated playbooks for breakdowns, delays, and priority insertions. Mobile apps keep drivers connected even during connectivity loss."
