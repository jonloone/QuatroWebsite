    description: "Equipment health data is trapped in siloed historians and disconnected monitoring tools with no unified view across all sites."
  - title: "Reactive Maintenance Cycles"
    description: "Without predictive analytics, maintenance is either calendar-based (wasteful) or failure-based (costly emergency repairs)."
  - title: "Manual Analysis Bottlenecks"
    description: "Engineers spend 20+ hours per month manually correlating data and chasing false alarms instead of solving high-value problems."
  - title: "Lifecycle Tracking Gaps"
    description: "Asset information scattered across procurement, operations, and maintenance systems makes replacement planning error-prone."
