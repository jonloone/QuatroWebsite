challenges:
  - title: "Data Silos Across Domains"
    description: "IT, OT, IoT, and enterprise systems operate in isolation. Operators must stitch together partial views from 5-7 different dashboards."
  - title: "Reactive Decision-Making"
    description: "Without AI-driven analytics, operators discover problems only after they manifest as incidents. The window for proactive intervention is lost."
  - title: "No Living Operational Model"
    description: "Organizations lack a real-time digital twin that mirrors current conditions and enables simulation before committing to production changes."
  - title: "Manual Analysis Bottlenecks"
    description: "Engineers spend 20+ hours per month aggregating data from multiple systems while high-value expertise is consumed by low-value data wrangling."
