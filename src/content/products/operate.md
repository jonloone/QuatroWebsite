## Operational Intelligence at Scale

From monitoring dashboards to predictive maintenance, Operate gives you the tools to run smarter operations.

### Built on Connect

Operate leverages the unified data foundation provided by Connect. Every data point from every source is available for monitoring, analysis, and prediction — no additional integration required.

### AI-Powered Insights

Machine learning models trained on your operational data surface insights that traditional analytics miss. Anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and pattern recognition work continuously in the background.

### Designed for Operators

Purpose-built for industrial operations, not adapted from IT monitoring tools. Role-based dashboards, industrial-grade reliability, and interfaces designed for control room environments.
