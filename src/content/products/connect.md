## Deployment Options

Deploy anywhere your operations run — cloud, on-premises, edge, or all three.

### Cloud
Fully managed SaaS deployment with automatic scaling, updates, and maintenance. Zero infrastructure overhead.

**Best for:** Teams wanting fastest time-to-value with minimal IT involvement.

### On-Premises
Deploy within your data center or private cloud for complete data sovereignty and network isolation.

**Best for:** Regulated industries requiring data residency and air-gapped environments.

### Edge
Lightweight deployment on edge hardware for local processing, buffering, and real-time response at remote sites.

**Best for:** Distributed operations with intermittent connectivity or latency-sensitive processes.

### Hybrid
Combine edge, on-premises, and cloud deployments into a unified architecture with seamless data flow between tiers.

**Best for:** Enterprise operations spanning multiple sites, regions, and network boundaries.

## Proof Point

**Industry:** Oil & Gas

**Headline:** Global Operator Replaces 40+ Legacy Databases With a Single Platform

A Fortune 500 oil and gas operator consolidated 40+ regional historian databases across upstream, midstream, and downstream operations into a unified Connect deployment. The result: real-time visibility across 200,000+ data points, 60% reduction in integration maintenance, and a foundation for predictive analytics that was impossible with fragmented legacy systems.
